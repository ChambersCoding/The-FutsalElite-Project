				<blockquote>
				<p>Kenny has been working with my son Kieran, 17, since an early age, providing both coaching and football mentoring support. 
				I have often braved the elements to stand and observe Kenny's innovative training routines which have developed Kieran's technique,
				 football brain and lately his physical attributes. 
				For example, regarding the latter, Kenny has been working with Kieran to improve his core strength, agility, fitness and acceleration, much-needed tools as 
				he is slight-framed. </p>

				<p>
				After only a few weeks into this training schedule Kieran showed a marked improvement and suddenly found that he was able to cope physically 
				against boys he was previously struggling with. I have also observed Kenny in game situations and he is a brilliant coach who reaches out to his
				players far better than any of the Sunday league football coaches I have seen. 
				I would say that he is equipped to coach or manage at the highest level in the professional game and cannot recommend him highly enough.

				<p>My sons aged 8 and 10 years have had 1:1 sessions for the past 3 months. 
				They have worked on several techniques; also improving their concentration and general physical development.
				1:1 sessions has allowed to work on their individual weaknesses. </p> 
				<p> In such a short time I have seen a great improvement and confidence growth.
				I would recommend them to anyone and for me it is no surprise that Futsal Elite have developed so many players.

				<p>A perfect blend of technical coaching alongside development of agility and athleticism. </p>
				<p>The coaching is innovative and imaginative, with a great focus on developing skill and encouraging creativity, but also teaching game awareness.
