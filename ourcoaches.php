		<h3>Kenny Rickelsford</h3>
		<p>	Having coached for over nine years, I have learnt many different
			coaching styles through observing at all levels of the game. I
			continuously develop as a coach by reading books, game analysis and my
			dedication to research in sports and psychology. </p>

			<p>Through my experience I have found the player-centred coaching style
			and a ‘street football’ playing philosophy has a huge influence on my
			teachings and methodology. </p>

			<p>I try to be the best coach possible as one of the five most common
			reasons for dropping out of sport for young people are related to the
			coach; therefore my purpose is to create an environment that is
			enjoyable.</p>

			<ul class="container_list"  >
			<strong>Some of my Coaching Philosophies:</strong>
			<li>Players develop understanding and learn more effectively when they are
			involved in solving problems for themselves.</li>
			<li>Players are more productive if they enjoy what they do.</li>
			<li>Provide individual instruction more so than to everybody as it
			penetrates better than group instructions.</li>
			<li>Encourage players to manage their thinking by making decisions promptly.</li>
			<li>Encourage players to set goals and believe in themselves.</li>
			<li>Encouraging creativity and imagination.</li>

		<h3>Alfie Rowlands-Rickelsford</h3>
			<p>I decided to begin my coaching journey over 8 years ago and have loved
				every process. I have increased my learning by attending FA and UEFA
				accredited courses and establishing links with affiliated coaches and
				viewing their sessions. My heightened learning comes from reading
				various sports coaching biographies and sports psychology books.
			</p>

			<p>I am a great believer of guided discovery which allows players to
			trial, experiment and learn through their own mistakes with occasional
			‘controlled’ assistance. Creating a ‘deep learning practice zone’ is
			vitally important to me. An environment with constant repetitive
			practices with high tempo allows new techniques, skills and decisions
			to become subconscious.
			</p>

			<p><strong>Some of my Coaching Philosophies:</strong></p>
			<ul class="container_list"  >
			<li>Making sure we all respect one another. We listen, we share ideas and
			install the same values and disciplines associated with being in the
			public eye.</li>
			<li>Create fun and stimulating practices (avoiding queues/waiting time)etc.</li>
			<li>Encourage players to make mistakes during practices or games as this
			will help them develop solutions when faced in similar situations..</li>
			<li>Praise those who attempt to be creative without fear of failure.</li>
			<li>Praise those who are persistent in executing new skills and techniques.</li>
			<li>Encouraging creativity and imagination</li>

			</ul>
