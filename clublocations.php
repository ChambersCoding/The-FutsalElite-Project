    <h1>About our Classes</h1>

    
    <strong> How can your child benefit from attending one of our Futsal Clubs and our 1:1 training? </strong>

    <p style="font-style: italic;"> “To achieve excellence in any domain, individuals have to spend a considerable amount of time trying to
     improve performance through practice-related activities” </p>
    
    <p>At Futsal Elite we challenge the belief that many lay people and some coaches, 
    that skilled players are “gifted” or possess certain innate talents or abilities that predispose them towards achieving excellence within sport.</p>

    <p style="font-style: italic;"> “By the time a player makes his debut in the premier league, the amount of hour’s accumulated practice is likely to exceed 10,000 hours” </p>
    
    <strong>    - Research Institute for Sport and Exercise Scientists, Liverpool John Moores University <br>
                - School of Human Kinetics, University of British Coloumbia, Canada </strong>
    <br><br>
     <p>Therefore a significant investment of practice time and effort is required to reach an elite level of performance. 
     We illustrate and rely on our evidence-based practices in developing elite mavericks. 
     We symbolize the importance of elite practice and elite instruction which leads to the road of excellence; they are the key ingredients to success.</p>

     <p>Our coaches are UEFA Qualified and have coached within the elite levels of football for several years. 
     For this reason, taking this opportunity to attend will grant your child with an abundance of hours in elite practice and instruction, 
     which will guarantee improvement in their performance and more importantly fun!</p>

                <p>I have found the Futsal Elite experience to be nothing but professional, educational, inspiring and most of all fun. 
                My 7 year old who had shyness issues has been coached and mentored with skill and kindness. 
                His fellow club members are taught respect by both lesson and example, the end result being a boy who would play Futsal every night of the week.
                 I cannot recommend them highly enough.
